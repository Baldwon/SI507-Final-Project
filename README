This is a README to tell you how the program works.

Firstly, the program will prompt you for valid service type(hotel or experience), if you choose invalid input, you will be asked for selecting again.

--> If hotel service is choosen, then, you can input <1> search word(city, such as NY/ Los Angeles, etc.)
                                                     <2> check in date
                                                     <3> check out date
                                                     <4> number of adults

Then, it will return you with the information of around 20 hotels.
A plot will be shown by brower, using rating/price per night of different hotels
If the information is not in cache, it will be stored into cache and database. 

--> If experience is chosen, then, you can input <1> search word(such as San Diego, etc.)
                                                 <2> check in date
                                                 <3> check out date     

Then, it will return you with the information of around 20 recommended experience.
If the information is not in cache, it will be stored into cache and database.
